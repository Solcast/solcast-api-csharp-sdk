# Tmy Data API

TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) is a collation of historical weather data for a specified location for a one year period. The dataset is derived from a multi-year time series specifically selected so that it presents the unique weather phenomena for the location, and provides annual averages that are consistent with long term averages.

The module TmyClient has the following available methods:
